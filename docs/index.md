ATOS, an ISO 22133-compliant and ROS2-based scenario execution engine, controls, monitors and coordinates both physical and virtual vehicles and equipment according to scenarios specified in the ASAM OpenSCENARIOÂ® format. It is made for running in real-time and uses GPS time to ensure exact and repeatable execution between runs.
