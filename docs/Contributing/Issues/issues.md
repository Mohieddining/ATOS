## Bug reports

A bug is an error, flaw or fault in the design of a piece of software or code.
We welcome bug reports, as they are extremely helpful in furthering the development of the project.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash;
A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS are you using, which
browser is used for the gui?What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

The issue report template is present in the issues tab on gihub, but the main points are also shown below:
