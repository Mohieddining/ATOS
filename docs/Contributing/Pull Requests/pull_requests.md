## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are great.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing new features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project. 

[The discussions tab](https://github.com/RI-SE/ATOS/discussions) on the repo can be for this if you want to make sure that your endevour is something the maintainers consider relevant for the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the
project.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
